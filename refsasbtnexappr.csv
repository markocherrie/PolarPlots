Before modeling associations with air pollution, outcome variables were log transformed if necessary to reduce skew. Associations with both pre- and post-exercise measures were examined. We employed linear mixed effect regression models in order to account for repeated measures among study participants. Participants were treated as random effects and time-invariant individual covariates as well as time-variant environmental variables were treated as fixed effects. Age, sex, body mass index (BMI =25, >25), smoking history (never, ever), and dichotomous variables for medication use (statins, other cardiovascular drugs) were included as covariates in all models. Height and use of respiratory medication were also included in spirometry models. Selection of the optimal covariance structure to account for serial correlation was based on minimization of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and examination of plots of the covariance. We accounted for effects of time (trend and temporal cycles) using a linear function of time and day of week variables. Air pollution variables were entered into models at individual lags of 0 to 2 days, each with natural spline functions of temperature with 3 degrees of freedom at individual lags of 0 to 2 days (nine models per pollutant). We analyzed associations separately for 2014 and 2015 and examined heterogeneity between years using Cochran Q statistic.14 If the P value of Q was more than 0.05, we calculated fixed effects pooled estimates combining the 2 years.
Models with AIC exceeding that of the best fitting model by 9 or more were considered to have substantially worse fit to the data.16 Statistical analyses were conducted in SAS EG (64 bit) version 5.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) and R version RX64 3.2.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).","Pollutant concentrations were generally similar in 2014 and 2015, with the exception of PM2.5 concentrations, which were somewhat higher in 2015 (, and SO2 concentrations, which were somewhat higher in 2014. Twelve percent of days were classified as smoky in both 2014 and 2015. The 75th percentile of the AQHI fell at the top of the “low health risk” category both years and the 75th percentile of the AQI was at the top of the “good” category in 2014 and bottom of the “moderate” category in 2015. The maxima of the AQHI and AQI were, respectively, at the top of the “moderate health risk” and bottom of the “unhealthy for sensitive groups” categories in 2014 and middle of the “moderate health risk” and top of the “moderate” category in 2015. Spearman correlations among pollutants and temperature are summarized in Table 3. CO and NO2 were highly correlated both years, while PM2.5 was more highly correlated with CO, NO2, and SO2 in 2014 than in 2015. O3 was poorly or negatively correlated with other pollutants but highly correlated with temperature in both years. Ox was more highly correlated with the AQHI than the AQI and was weakly correlated with individual pollutants other than O3. The AQHI was more highly correlated with NO2 than with PM2.5, whereas the converse was true for the AQI, and both were moderately correlated with CO in both 2014 and 2015. The AQI and AQHI were also highly correlated with each other.

Pooled estimates of effects in 2014 and 2015 indicated a significant reduction in heart rate [-1.4%, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.4, to -2.3], diastolic (-1.0%, 95% CI -0.3, -1.8%) and systolic blood pressure (-1.2%, 95% CI -0.5%, -1.9%), and FEV1 (-8.3%, 95% CI -7.0%, -9.6%) over the course of the study. No consistent associations were observed between day of study and other cardiorespiratory measures or urinary oxidative stress markers (not shown).
In particular, heart rate exhibited significant positive associations with CO (lag 1), NO2 (lag 1), O3 (lag 0), PM2.5 (lags 1 and 2), and SO2 (lag 2). Diastolic and systolic blood pressure exhibited significant negative associations at lag 1 day with CO, NO2, and PM2.5, while decreased FEV1 was only significantly associated with NO2 (lag 1). All of these significant associations were insensitive to temperature lag. Associations with individual pollutants were consistently of greatest magnitude for NO2.

Evidence suggests that increased air pollution leads to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of this review was to systematically review and synthesize scientific evidence to understand the effect of performing outdoor physical activity (PA) in a polluted environment on cardiovascular outcomes. This review was developed and reported in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Electronic searches in Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed were undertaken through March 2021 initially, and later updated through to 31st January 2022, for observational studies published in peer-reviewed journals that report cardiovascular mortality or morbidity due to outdoor PA in air polluted environment. These searches yielded 10,840 citations. Two reviewers independently reviewed each citation for its eligibility. Seven studies were found to be eligible. Of these, five were cohort studies and two were cross-sectional studies. Pollutants measured in the selected studies were Particulate Matter (PM)-PM10, PM2.5, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ozone (O-3). The most common study outcome was myocardial infarction, followed by cardiovascular mortality, hypertension and heart rate variability. Six studies emphasized that the PA has beneficial effects on cardiovascular outcomes, though air pollutants attenuate this effect to an extent. Two studies showed that walking, even in the polluted environment, significantly reduced the heart rate and heart rate variability indices. The beneficial effects of outdoor PA outweigh the harmful effects of air pollution on cardiovascular health, though the benefits reduce to an extent when PA is carried out in a polluted environment. Because a limited number of studies (n = 7) were eligible for inclusion, the review further emphasizes the critical need for more primary studies that differentiate between outdoor and indoor PA and its effect on cardiovascular health.","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 19:17",NA,"review","Yes","outdoor",NA,NA,NA,"yes","no","physical activity","not sure / for discussion","This is a review","ML",NA,NA,"NO2",NA,NA,NA,"sex",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"out",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to quantify the tradeoff of PA under fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution by estimating the optimal PA duration under various pollution levels. Methods: A risk-benefit analysis was performed to estimate the optimal outdoor moderate-intensity PA (MPA) duration under varying PM2.5 concentrations. Results: An inverse nonlinear relationship was identified between optimal MPA duration and background PM2.5 concentration levels. When background PM2.5 concentration increased to 186 mu g/m(3), the optimal outdoor MPA duration decreased to 2.5 h/week, the minimum level recommended by current PA guidelines. When background PM(2.5 )concentration further increased to 235 mu g/m(3), the optimal outdoor MPA duration decreased to 1 h/week. The relationship between optimal MPA duration and background PM2.5 concentration levels was stronger when exercising at a location closer to a source of air pollution. Compared to the general adult population, adults aged 60 years and older had substantially steeper curves-the optimal outdoor MPA duration decreased to 2.5 h/week when background PM2.5 concentration reached 45 mu g/m(3). Conclusion: The health benefit of outdoor MPA by far outweighs the health risk of PM2.5 pollution for the global average urban background concentration (22 mu g/m(3)). This modeling study examined a single type of air pollutant and suffered from measurement errors and estimation uncertainties.

We investigated the impact of separately estimating NO2 long-term outdoor exposures at home, work/school, and while commuting on the association between this marker of exposure and potential health outcomes. We used spatially and temporally resolved commuter route data and model-based NO2 estimates of a population sample in Basel, Switzerland, to assign individual NO2-exposure estimates of increasing complexity, namely (1) home outdoor concentration; (2) time-weighted home and work/school concentrations; and (3) time-weighted concentration incorporating home, work/school and commute. On the basis of their covariance structure, we estimated the expectable relative differences in the regression slopes between a quantitative health outcome and our measures of individual NO2 exposure using a standard measurement error model. The traditional use of home outdoor NO2 alone indicated a 12% (95% Cl: 11-14%) underestimation of related health effects as compared with integrating both home and work/school outdoor concentrations. Mean contribution of commuting to total weekly exposure was small (3.2%; range 0.1-13.5%). Thus, ignoring commute in the total population may not significantly underestimate health effects as compared with the model combining home and work/school. For individuals commuting between Basel-City and Basel-Country, ignoring commute may produce, however, a significant attenuation bias of 4% (95% Cl: 4-5%). Our results illustrate the importance of including work/school locations in assessments of long-term exposures to traffic-related air pollutants such as NO2.

Methods-Six major urban air pollutants were examined: carbon monoxide (CO); nitrogen oxides (NOx); ozone (O-3); particulate matter (PM10); sulphur dioxide (SO2); volatile organic compounds (VOCS). Results-CO is detrimental to athletic performance. NO2 is of concern to human health, but outdoor levels are low. O-3 poses a potentially serious risk to exercising athletes. Decrements in lung function result from exposure, and there is evidence that athletic performance may be affected. Detrimental effects may occur at low ambient levels, but there is no scientific consensus on this matter. PM10 is causing concern in the scientific community. Blood lead accumulation during exercise indicates that personal exposure to toxic compounds associated with PM10 may be magnified. Generally, outdoor ambient levels of SO2 are too low to cause a problem to the athlete, except the asthmatic athlete. The few studies on exposure of exercisers to VOCs are reviewed. Conclusions-Athletes and exercisers should avoid exercising by the road side even though levels of the more noxious air pollutants have been controlled in the United Kingdom. O-3 is particularly damaging to athletes; it reaches its highest concentrations on hot bright days in rural areas.","British Journal of Sports Medicine, 35:4  214-222",NA,"review",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"physical activity; athletes",NA,NA,"ST",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"out","Publication year is 2001 and therefore not within scope for this review",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pregnant women are mobile and locations they spend time in contribute to their personal PM2.5 exposures. Therefore, it is important to understand how mobility and exposures encountered within activity spaces contribute to personal PM2.5 exposures during pregnancy. Methods: We collected 48-h integrated personal PM2.5 samples and continuous geolocation (GPS) data for 213 predominantly Hispanic/Latina pregnant women in their 3(rd) trimester in Los Angeles, CA. We also collected questionnaires and modeled outdoor air pollution and meteorology in their residential neighborhood. We calculated three GPS-derived activity space measures of exposure to road networks, greenness (NDVI), parks, traffic volume, walkability, and outdoor PM2.5 and temperature. We used bivariate analyses to screen variables (GPS-extracted exposures in activity spaces, individual characteristics, and residential neighborhood exposures) based on their relationship with personal, 48-h integrated PM2.5 concentrations. We then built a generalized linear model to explain the variability in personal PM2.5 exposure and identify key contributing factors. Results: Indoor PM2.5 sources, parity, and home ventilation were significantly associated with personal exposure. Activity-space based exposure to roads was associated with significantly higher personal PM2.5 exposure, while greenness was associated with lower personal PM2.5 exposure (beta =-3.09 mu g/m(3) per SD increase in NDVI, p-value = 0.018). The contribution of outdoor PM2.5 to personal exposure was positive but relatively lower (beta = 2.05 mu g/m(3) per SD increase, p-value = 0.016) than exposures in activity spaces and the indoor environment. The final model explained 34% of the variability in personal PM2.5 concentrations. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of activity spaces and the indoor environment on personal PM2.5 exposures of pregnant women living in Los Angeles, CA.

In the UK, recent initiatives at local council level have focussed on mitigating children?s air pollution exposure at school. However, an overview of the available evidence on concentration and exposure in school environments - and a summary of key knowledge gaps - has so far been lacking. To address this, we conducted a review bringing together recent academic and grey literature, relating to air quality in outdoor school environments - including playgrounds, drop-off zones, and the school commute - across high-income countries. We aimed to critically assess, synthesise, and categorise the available literature, to produce recommendations on future research and mitigating actions. Our searches initially identified 883 articles of interest, which were filtered down in screening and appraisal to a final total of 100 for inclusion. Many of the included studies focussed on nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (PM) in both the coarse and fine fractions, around schools across a range of countries. Some studies also observed ozone (O3) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) outside schools. Our review identified evidence that children can encounter pollution peaks on the school journey, at school gates, and in school playgrounds; that nearby traffic is a key determinant of concentrations outside schools; and that factors relating to planning and urban design ? such as the type of playground paving, and amount of surrounding green space ? can influence school site concentrations. The review also outlines evidence gaps that can be targeted in future research. These include the need for more personal monitoring studies that distinguish between the exposure that takes place indoors and outdoors at school, and a need for a greater number of studies that conduct before-after evaluation of local interventions designed to mitigate children?s exposure, such as green barriers and road closures. Finally, our review also proposes some tangible recommendations for policymakers and local leaders. The creation of clean air zones around schools; greening of school grounds; careful selection of new school sites; promotion of active travel to and from school; avoidance of major roads on the school commute; and scheduling of outdoor learning and play away from peak traffic hours, are all advocated by the evidence collated in this review.","Environmental Research, 196:",NA,"review",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"school",NA,NA,"ST","literature review","Air quality around schools","NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5, SO2","general ambient air pollution","school children","school children; subananlysis considered socioeconomic inequalities (Table 6, p.12)","age, race","x","x","x","time spent outside around the school e.g. playground, drop off/pick up zone, sports fields, nearby roads and commute.","school playgrounds and sports fields, commute","x",NA,"Papers that measured or modelled air pollution concentration sin outdoor school environments including the commute.

Socioeconomic status (SES) is known to be associated with both air pollution exposure and respiratory function. This study assesses the role of SES either as confounder or effect modifier of the association between ambient air pollution and lung function. Cross-sectional data from three European multicenter adult cohorts were pooled to assess factors associated with lung function, including annual means of home outdoor NO2. Pre-bronchodilator lung function was measured according to the ATS-criteria. Multiple mixed linear models with random intercepts for study areas were used. Three different factors (education, occupation and neighborhood unemployment rate) were considered to represent SES. NO2 exposure was negatively associated with lung function. Occupation and neighborhood unemployment rates were not associated with lung function. However, the inclusion of the SES-variable education improved the models and the air pollution-lung function associations got slightly stronger. NO2 associations with lung function were not substantially modified by SES-variables.

We applied multiple mixed linear models to analyze the role of SES in the associations between NO2 and lung function and used the study area as a random intercept. Regarding SES, we included the following variables: Educational level (three categories), occupation (manual compared to non-manual), and the neighborhood-level variable tertile of unemployment rate. Models were adjusted for the basic variables sex, age, age squared, height, height squared and additionally for the lifestyle variables smoking status (i.e., current, former, or never smoker), pack-years and pack-years squared (each with separate terms for current and former smokers), BMI (body mass index), and BMI squared. We systematically ran analyses for the full sample (n = 6502) and for a reduced sample (n = 4766) since the unemployment rate was not available for three study areas. Likelihood-ratio (LR) tests and AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) were used to assess the contribution of SES factors to the models. Effect modification of SES on the association of lung function and NO2 were tested by including interactions terms in the models. We carried out the following sensitivity analyses: a) A meta-analysis comparing and combining study area-specific results to assess heterogeneity of associations between study sites, b) a three-level model using neighborhood level further nested within the study area, c) a three-level model taking the family structure of EGEA into account, and d) interaction analyses excluding the lifestyle variables (smoking status, pack-years and BMI) to assess whether SES and NO2 interact when these possible mediator variables are excluded and thus might only be implicitly contained in SES. We used the statistical software Stata (StataCorp 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14.

Our results add evidence towards a causal role of ambient air pollution in reducing lung function. It remains unclear whether NO2 health effects are clearly attributable to NO2 itself, or whether NO2 serves as a proxy for other polluting agents from combustion or traffic sources [24]. Whereas direct effects of NO2 on exacerbations of asthma have been established [25,26], the causal understanding of the independent effect of long-term exposure to NO2 on cardio-respiratory morbidity including lung function remains poor in the light of the small number of studies investigating two- or even three-pollutant models [27].","not sure / for discussion","Wasn't sure on this one - can you please double check relevance.

Objective: To identify and summarize the evidence regarding SEP as an effect modifier of the association between asthma exacerbations and outdoor air pollution in children. Methods: We conducted searches in five electronic databases from January 1950 to June 2015 with no language restriction. Observational studies involving children, measuring any non-biological outdoor air pollutant exposure, resulting in any asthma-related health service use, and reporting measures of effect by individual or aggregated SEP measures were included. Results: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Five studies reported on hospitalizations, three on emergency department visits, one on ambulatory visits, and one on repeat hospital visits. Six studies identified differential effects of the effect of air pollution on asthma outcomes by SEP with stronger effects for children with a low SEP level; however, the analysis of interaction between air pollutants and SEP was significant in one study of asthma hospitalizations only. The differential effect was reported using individual and aggregated SEP measures. Conclusion: This review reveals that there is weak evidence of SEP as an effect-modifier of the association between air pollution and children's asthma exacerbations.

Objectives: Assess and compare the association between SEP and outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure as a marker of traffic exhaust, in 16 cities from eight Western European countries. Methods: Three SEP indicators, two defined at individual-level (education and occupation) and one at neighborhood-level (unemployment rate) were assessed in three European multicenter cohorts. NO2 annual concentration exposure was estimated at participants' addresses with land use regression models developed within the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE; http://www.escapeproject.eu/). Pooled and city specific linear regressions were used to analyze associations between each SEP indicator and NO2. Heterogeneity across cities was assessed using the Higgins' I-squared test (I-2). Results: The study population included 5692 participants. Pooled analysis showed that participants with lower individual-SEP were less exposed to NO2. Conversely, participants living in neighborhoods with higher iinemployment rate were more exposed. City-specific results exhibited strong heterogeneity (I-2 > 76% for the three SEP indicators) resulting in variation of the individual- and neighborhood-SEP patterns of NO2 exposure across cities. The coefficients from a model that included both individual- and neighborhood-SEP indicators were similar to the unadjusted coefficients, suggesting independent associations. Conclusions: Our study showed for the first time using homogenized measures of outcome and exposure across 16 cities the important heterogeneity regarding the association between SEP and NO2 in Western Europe. Importantly, our results showed that individual- and neighborhood-SEP indicators capture different aspects of the association between SEP and exposure to air pollution, stressing the importance of considering both in air pollution health effects studies.

However, there is not currently a full and clear understanding of how many schools in England are in locations with high concentrations of air pollutants, and few studies have examined potential associations between air quality outside schools and socio-economic inequalities. To address these gaps, in this part of our study we used modelled air pollution concentrations, as well as monitoring data, to estimate how many schools in England are co-located with levels of annual mean PM2.5 that exceed the WHO recommended annual mean limit of 10 mu gm- 3, and matched school annual mean PM2.5 concentrations to inequality metrics. We assessed the limitations of our methodology by carrying out a sensitivity analysis using a small patch of high-resolution air pollution data generated using a data extrapolation method. Mapping of modelled annual mean concentrations at school locations indicates that around 7800 schools in England - over a third of schools - are in areas where annual mean PM2.5 in 2017 exceeded the WHO recommended guideline (10 mu gm- 3). Currently over 3.3 million pupils are attending these schools. We also found that air pollution outside schools is likely to be compounding existing childhood socio-economic disadvantage. Schools in areas with high annual mean PM2.5 levels ( 12 mu gm- 3) had a significantly higher median intake of pupils on free school meals (17.8%) compared to schools in low PM2.5 areas (<6 mu gm- 3 PM2.5, 6.5% on free school meals). Schools in the highest PM2.5 concentration range had significantly higher ethnic minority pupil proportion (78.3%) compared to schools in the lowest concentration range (6.8%).

School %FSM and IDACI was compared across PM2.5 ranges using boxplots, and linear regression was applied to determine whether PM2.5 concentration, as a continuous variable, was a predictor of school %FSM and school LSOA IDACI rank. All statistical analysis was conducted in R (R Core Team, 2018). Linear and polynomial models were compared to determine whether associations were linear or non-linear. Model fit was compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The AIC is calculated from the log-likelihood – a measure of model fit – and the number of model parameters (equal to the number of variables in the model plus the intercept). The AIC enables the relative comparison of model quality, and penalises for model complexity (i.e. number of parameters) to identify the ‘best’ available model with the simplest possible structure. The best available model is the one with the minimum AIC value, and a model is considered to be significantly better than another if the difference between the AIC values – hereafter referred to as the delta-AIC – is greater than 2 (Burnham K & Anderson D, 2002). Model assumptions were tested using diagnostic plots.

We tested the limitations associated with low-resolution data in a sensitivity analysis, comparing against high-resolution (100 m × 100 m) NO2 and PM2.5 data published by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) (De Hoogh, 2019). As this data relates to 2010, we applied a data extrapolation methodology to convert the data to the year 2017, so that it related to the same year as the UK-Air annual mean concentration maps. Due to computational and resource limitations, we carried out the extrapolation method on a small patch of the SAHSU dataset – an area covering three northern local authorities (Leeds, Bradford, and Calderdale).

sensitivity analysis using a small patch of high-resolution air pollution data generated using a data extrapolation method","Regression analysis indicated that annual mean PM2.5 concentration is significantly associated with school %FSM (p < 0.05). 
Schools with the lowest levels of PM2.5 (6 µgm-3 or less) have a particularly low median %FSM (6.5%), while schools with the highest levels (12 µgm-3 or higher) have a particularly high median %FSM (17.8%).

chools in areas with low annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 tend to be in LSOAs with a higher IDACI rank (i.e. lower child deprivation), and schools in higher annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 areas tend to be in LSOAs with a lower IDACI rank (i.e. higher child deprivation). schools with higher annual mean PM2.5 concentrations are more likely than low PM2.5 schools to have a high deprived pupil intake and are more likely to be located in neighbourhoods with high levels of child income deprivation.
 schools in areas with low annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 in 2017 tended to have a large majority of white British pupils. schools in high PM2.5 areas tended to be more ethnically diverse: the 1496 schools with annual PM2.5 means greater than 12 µgm-3 had a total white British percentage in the 2017/18 academic year of 21.7%, and percentages ranging from 8.4 to 22.9% across the other ethnicity categories. Regression analysis indicated a significant association between the pupil proportion in a school who are white British (a proxy for school diversity), and the annual PM2.5 means of the school (p < 0.05).

This study seeks to address this gap by examining if socially disadvantaged children are disproportionately located in public school districts burdened by higher vehicular pollution in Texas-the second largest US state based on population size. Vehicular pollution exposure is measured using two variables: (1) an index developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency that combines traffic proximity and volume; and (2) outdoor concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a widely used proxy for traffic-related air pollution. These variables are linked to school district level data on socio-demographic characteristics of children obtained from the latest American Community Survey. Statistical analysis is based on multivariable generalized estimating equations that account for spatial clustering of school districts. Results reveal significantly greater traffic proximity and NO2 exposure in Texas school districts with higher percentages of children, after controlling for clustering, population density, and other socio-demographic factors. Districts exposed to higher levels of traffic proximity and NO2 exposure also contain significantly greater proportions of racial/ethnic minority, foreign-born, disabled, and socioeconomically vulnerable children. These findings highlight the urgent need to develop mitigation strategies for reducing vehicular pollution exposure, especially in districts with higher proportions of socially disadvantaged students that could be additionally burdened with limited resources. School districts represent a policy relevant analytic unit since school district boards can act as advocates for the environmental health of children and implement mitigation strategies for reducing pollution exposure.","Environmental Research, 204:",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"school children",NA,NA,"EC","National scale modelling study","Are socially disadvantaged children disproportionately located in public school districts burdened by higher vehicular pollution in Texas","NO2","Traffic-related air pollution","Children (racial/ethnic minority, foreign-born, disabled, and socioeconomically vulnerable children)","aged less than 18 years residing in Texas public school districts","age, disability, race","x","x","x","Districts exposed to higher levels of traffic proximity and NO2 exposure also contain significantly greater proportions of racial/ethnic minority, foreign-born, disabled, and socioeconomically vulnerable children.","x","x",NA,"traffic proximity score and average annual concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2),- 

Traffic proximity score - the count of vehicles per day within 500 m of a census block centroid, divided by distance (meters), computed as the population-weighted average of census blocks in any chosen area (e.g., census block group).  To calculate traffic proximity at the school district level, traffic proximity indicator values for all block groups located within a school district were multiplied by the total population of each block group (2017), summed, and divided by the total population of the school district, following the methodology recommended for upscaling values of this indicator (USEPA, 2019).

Ccensus block group level values of predicted NO2 spatial concentrations and locational coordinates of block group centroids were downloaded from the CACES Land Use Regression database for 2011 to 2015 (latest year available), and the mean annual concentration for this five-year timeframe was estimated for all block groups in Texas. NO2 exposure for each public school district was then estimated by calculating the arithmetic mean of the predicted annual NO2 concentrations (2011–2015) for all block groups whose centroids were located within the school district boundary.

Geographic boundaries of all public school districts in Texas (n = 1020) were downloaded from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data portal, for the 2018–2019 school year (NCES, 2021).

To analyze relationships between vehicular pollution exposure and socio-demographic characteristics of children in more detail, this study utilizes generalized estimating equations (GEEs)--a multivariable modeling technique that extends the generalized linear model to accommodate clustered data (Nelder and Wedderburn, 1972; Garson, 2013). GEEs are particularly suitable here because they account for clustering in the data, relax several assumptions of traditional regression models, and provide several advantages compared to other modeling techniques. Since GEEs are based on theoretically informed clusters, they are more appropriate than spatial autoregressive models in which clusters or neighbors are defined somewhat arbitrarily based on contiguity or distance-based parameters. GEEs are also preferable to multilevel modeling approaches because the intra-cluster correlation estimates are adjusted for as nuisance parameters and not modeled (Collins et al., 2015). Additionally, they are more robust than other modeling approaches that consider non-independence of data (e.g., mixed models with random effects) since GEEs estimate unbiased population-averaged or marginal regression coefficients, which makes this approach suitable for analyzing general patterns of pollution across subgroups of people (Liang and Zeger, 1986; Collins et al., 2015). Mixed models with random effects, in contrast, generate cluster-specific results (Diggle et al., 1994) that may not provide as reliable an inferential basis for comparing various subgroups of children in this study.

Methods: Census tract population data were obtained from the National Statistics Institute of Spain. Outdoor NO2 was monitored in 100 sites in the study area, through the use of passive samplers, in three campaigns between 2002 and April 2004. Land use regression (LUR) was used to obtain a map of NO2 levels. The LUR predictions were compared with the NO2 level obtained by: a) the nearest sampler of the monitoring network, b) the nearest passive sampler, c) the mean distance-weighted levels of the samplers in the neighborhood, and d) the NO2 level obtained by using Kriging. For each census tract, the NO2 levels were obtained. The association of NO2 air pollution exposure with population age (>= 65 years) and the 5-category deprivation index was analyzed. Results: The LUR models showed less error than the other prediction methods. The safety levels proposed by the World Health Organization were exceeded in more than 99% of the population. An inverse relationship was found between NO2 levels and the deprivation index (beta = -2.01 mu g/m(3) in the most deprived quintile compared with lower deprivation, 95%CI: -3.07; -0.95) and a direct relationship was found with age (beta = 0.12 mu g/m(3) per unit increase in percentage of the population >= 65 years, 95%CI: 0.08; 0.16).

We examined the impact of outdoor air pollution on stroke survival by studying a population-based cohort. Methods-All patients who experienced their first-ever stroke between 1995 and 2005 in a geographically defined part of London, where road traffic contributes to spatial variation in air pollution, were followed up to mid-2006. Outdoor concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter <10 mu m in diameter modeled at a 20-m grid point resolution for 2002 were linked to residential postal codes. Hazard ratios were adjusted for age, sex, social class, ethnicity, smoking, alcohol consumption, prestroke functional ability, pre-existing medical conditions, stroke subtype and severity, hospital admission, and neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. Results-There were 1856 deaths among 3320 patients. Median survival was 3.7 years (interquartile range, 0.1 to 10.8). Mean exposure levels were 41 mu g/m(3) (SD, 3.3; range, 32.2 to 103.2) for nitrogen dioxide and 25 mu g/m(3) (SD, 1.3; range, 22.7 to 52) for particulate matter <10 mu m in diameter. A 10-mu g/m(3) increase in nitrogen dioxide was associated with a 28% (95% CI, 11% to 48%) increase in risk of death. A 10-mu g/m(3) increase in particulate matter <10 mu m in diameter was associated with a 52% (6% to 118%) increase in risk of death. Reduced survival was apparent throughout the follow-up period, ruling out short-term mortality displacement. Conclusions-Survival after stroke was lower among patients living in areas with higher levels of outdoor air pollution. If causal, a 10-mu g/m(3) reduction in nitrogen dioxide exposure might be associated with a reduction in mortality comparable to that for stroke units.

NO2 and PM10 were examined in separate analyses. Age and area-level deprivation were fitted as continuous variables. All other confounders were entered as categorical variables. The analyses were stratified by stroke subtype, Glasgow Coma Score, and social class, according to the modeling strategy described previously, wherein assumptions for proportional-hazards modeling were examined by using Schoenfeld residuals.10 We examined assumptions for NO2 and PM10 graphically (complementary log-log plots) and by statistical testing (ESTAT PHTEST option in STATA).

Elements of data were missing for various reasons, including death soon after stroke and incomplete information from next of kin and medical records. We therefore first analyzed data from cases with complete information only on all variables. We then imputed values for missing variables by using the ICE multiple-imputation procedure within STATA and reran the analyses on 10 imputed datasets.20 In the imputation, we included all explanatory variables and outcome information, as previous work has shown that outcome information should be included to avoid bias in estimation of effects.21 Pollutant values, deprivation, age, sex, outcome, and length of follow-up were not imputed because there were no missing values for these variables.

Sensitivity analyses included comparing the effects of pollutants on survival within 28 days of stroke with their effects on survival from 28 days onward, restricting the analyses to patients experiencing a stroke before November 2004 when the stroke area expanded by 2-fold, restricting the analyses to patients experiencing cerebral infarction, and excluding patients with high pollution exposure values.

We examined whether pollutant effects were modified by selected variables. We hypothesized that effects might be greater in older patients; smokers; patients with pre-existing hypertension, coronary heart disease, or diabetes; and patients who were incontinent of urine or unable to swallow.

Comparing scales of variation across the sampled population, greater differences arise from localized pollution gradients for BC and NO (pollutants dominated by primary sources) and from regional gradients for UFP and NO2 (pollutants dominated by secondary contributions).

The accident rate followed a downward and statistically significant trend (p = 0.001). The year with the highest accident rate was 2006, with 4981 occupational accidents per 100,000. Occupational accidents follow a temporary pattern (there are differences in the number of accidents according to the month of the year and to the day of the week). Exposure to PM10 and NO(2)increases the risk of having an accident at work, especially for outdoor workers. An increase of 10 mu g/m(3)in daily concentration resulted in increases in accidents for outdoor workers of 2.5% for PM10 and 6.4% for NO2.","International Journal of Biometeorology, 65:3  429-436",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"workers",NA,NA,"ST","descriptive analysis","impact of ambient air pollution on the prevalence of occupational accidents (outdoor workers) in Madrid","NO2, PM10","general ambient air pollution","outdoor workers","x",NA,"x","outdoor workers (construction, demolition, agriculture, forestry, livestock, fish farming","x","outdoor workers","x",NA,NA,"number of daily work accidents incl. sex, age, job type

This study aims to analyze, in a population of multiple pregnancies, the relationship between fetal growth restriction (FGR), small for gestational age (SGA) and exposure to air pollution in moderately polluted cities. Methods: All women with multiple pregnancies living in the city of Besancon or in the urban area of Dijon and who delivered at a university hospital between 2005 and 2009 were included. FGR and SGA were obtained from medical records. Outdoor residential nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure was assessed using the mother's address, considering a 50 m radius buffer over the following defined pregnancy periods: each trimester, entire pregnancy and two months before delivery. Logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: This study included 249 multiple pregnancies with 506 newborns. The median of NO2 concentration considering a 50 m radius buffer during entire pregnancy was 23.1 mu g/m(3) (minimum at 10.1 mu g/m(3) and maximum at 46.7 mu g/m(3)). No association was observed between NO2 and SGA whatever the pregnancy period (the odds ratio (OR) range 0.78 to 0.88). Regarding FGR, the OR associated with an increase of 10 mu g/m(3) of NO2 exposure during entire pregnancy was 1.52 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.02-2.26).

The participants' addresses at the date of delivery were extracted from CPAGE® software using the personal identification number and the date of delivery. This address identified the residential building. Two NO2 exposure assessments were calculated at each mother's building: considering a 50 m radius buffer centered on the building centroid (NO2,50m) and considering the 6 m perimeter around the façades of the building (NO2,6m) (Barba-Vasseur et al., 2017; Tenailleau et al., 2015; Tenailleau et al., 2016). The NO2 levels were calculated using a two-step emission and diffusion modeling. NO2 emissions were calculated from road traffic data using CIRCUL'AIR software, developed and used by all approved French Air Quality Monitoring Agencies (AASQA) (COPERT IV European standard methodology). AASQA's pollution emission inventory was used to assess NO2 emissions related to heating, industries and long-range sources. NO2 concentration was estimated 2 m above ground on a 25 m grid with reinforced gridding around the axes of emission, using the ADMS-Urban© software (CERC) for diffusion modeling. ESRI arcGIS© software (V10.1) was used for spatial interpolation to increase the spatial resolution of the ADMS output. NO2 concentration expressed in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) was thus calculated at a 4 m2 (2 m × 2 m) raster. The validity of the 2 m result was estimated on the basis of data from four, two-week-long measurement campaigns carried out during autumn and winter 2010 as well as spring and summer 2011. Measurements were based on 863 passive samplers and the nine AASQA air pollution measurement stations (ATMO Franche-Comté and Atmosf'Air Bourgogne). Validation statistics (r2) range from 0.64 to 0.69. Monthly maps of NO2 concentration were established from January 2004 to December 2009 using hourly meteorological data to account for the seasonal variations in NO2 concentrations. Using the monthly maps, time-weighted average NO2 exposure was assessed over the following defined pregnancy periods: first, second and third trimester, entire pregnancy and two months before delivery.","The median of NO2 concentration considering a 50 m radius buffer during entire pregnancy was 23.1 µg/m3 (minimum at 10.1 µg/m3 and maximum at 46.7 µg/m3).","x","pregnancy duration","all multiple pregnancies (n = 249) from  database of >10,000 deliveries over a 5-year period.","The association between NO2 exposure and SGA or FGR was estimated by univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses, where SGA or FGR were taken as binary outcomes in the models. A pregnancy was categorized as SGA (or FGR) if at least one fetus was SGA (or FGR). Departure from the assumption of linearity was tested by introducing a polynomial function of the NO2 exposure variables into the models. The OR were adjusted for: maternal age older than 35 years at delivery, low neighborhood socioeconomic level, maternal smoking during pregnancy, malnutrition, nulliparity, gestational hypertension and diabetes. Because of the non-random distribution of missing data, a missing data class was attributed to participants for whom no value for potential confounding variables was available. Only two adjustment factors of the model had missing data: malnutrition (n = 20) and maternal smoking during pregnancy (n = 16), affecting only 8% of pregnancies. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using different criteria to define NO2 exposure and SGA outcome. First, NO2 concentration considering the 6 m perimeter around the façades of the building, instead of considering a 50 m radius buffer was considered. Second, three other birth weight standards were used to define SGA as an outcome variable (Ego et al., 2016; Ferdynus et al., 2009; Rousseau et al., 2017). Furthermore, for some sensitivity analyses, triplets and same-sex twins were excluded. Indeed twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is a risk factor for fetal growth abnormalities in monochorionic twins. Because data concerning chorionicity was not available for our study, we did a sensitivity analysis on twins of different sex, who are necessarily dichorionic twins. A multilevel model was used to explore a potential hierarchical data structure. Maternal age at delivery was also considered for adjustment in continuous form, or with a second or third order polynomial. Finally, we adjusted the analyses for a supplementary fetal characteristic: the presence of major infant congenital abnormalities in at least one fetus of the pregnancy.

Equity in the spatial distribution of cycling risks in Los Angeles, CA","Introduction: The health benefits of cycling have widely been recognized, but cycling is also associated with health risks (e.g., pollution exposure, crash risk). Past studies of these competing health impacts have been limited in their treatment of social equity, rarely considering spatial variations in risk that could be highly salient for marginalized populations. This study investigates the health risks of cycling through the lens of social equity by considering variations in PM2.5 concentrations and crash risk across space and across sociodemographic groups. Methods: We conducted this analysis in Los Angeles County, CA, which has a relatively high bicycle fatality rate and consistent non-attainment status for traffic-related PM2.5. We used publicly available data, including PM2.5 concentrations, crash locations, bicycle counts, and street network data, to derive measures of pollution exposure and crash risk. We performed descriptive, visualization, and regression analyses to assess how pollution exposure and crash risk vary across census block groups and are associated with area-level sociodemographic characteristics. Results: We found that the health risks of cycling are disproportionately high among marginalized populations (i.e. in block groups with lower income, lower educational attainment, and higher shares of racial/ethnic minority populations). Census block groups with worse outdoor air quality and higher crash risk are particularly likely to be home to low-income people of color. Even in these places, the health benefits of cycling could outweigh the risks; however, the net health benefits of cycling, accounting for these risks, are likely to be lower in marginalized communities. Conclusions: Health impact assessments related to cycling should incorporate neighborhood-level data to better assess the distribution of benefits and risks across space and across population groups. Efforts to promote cycling should focus on making cycling safer and healthier, placing emphasis on communities where it is associated with the greatest health risks.","Journal of Transport & Health, 23:",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"physical activity; sociodemographic",NA,NA,"EC","cross-sectional analysis","This study investigates the health risks of cycling through the lens of social equity by considering variations in PM2.5 concentrations and crash risk across space and across sociodemographic groupS.","PM2.5","general outdoor air pollution","ethnic groups (black, hispanic), households in poverty, level of educational atainment","Los Angeles County, CA.

We separately modeled each of the three measures of cycling risk—PM2.5 concentrations, cycling fatality risk, and cycling injury risk—as a function of each sociodemographic characteristic, adjusting for population density. Each sociodemographic characteristic was modeled in a separate regression, and the specific regression method varied by dependent variable. For the continuous measure of PM2.5, we fit linear regressions. We treated the cycling fatality count variable as a binary outcome (since only one block group with any fatalities had more than one) and modeled this variable using logistic regression. For counts of cycling injuries, which were greater in number and variation than fatalities, we fit negative binomial regression models. In the fatality (binary) and injury (count) models, we controlled for our measure of cycling activity to account for risk exposure; this allowed us to adjust for higher crash-related risks that could occur simply due to a higher level of cycling activity in a given block group.

In the second set of regression models with the same three dependent variables above, we examined interaction terms between selected measures of race and socioeconomic status. Specifically, we used the regression methods described above to model each dependent variable as a function of percent non-Hispanic White, income, an interaction term between those two variables, and population density; the fatality (binary) and injury (count) models were further adjusted for cycling activity, for the reasons noted above. These models allowed us to assess whether associations between race and cycling risk varied by income level and vice versa, thus offering a more complete picture of the nuanced relationships between these variables.

The generally utilized approach to assess potential areas of environmental justice concern relies on static comparisons of environmental and demographic information to identify areas where minority and low income populations experience elevated environmental exposures, but does not include any additional information that may inform the trade-offs that sub-populations of varying socio-demographic groups make when choosing where to reside in cities.

SAS for windows version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, U.S.) was used for all analyses in this study.","This population has a different time-location patterns from the U.S. general population, with particularly longer time spent outdoors in the neighborhoods (The disadvantaged socioeconomic status was the predominant reason). The elevated neighborhood concentrations of air toxics and the large amount of time spent outdoors likely place this disadvantaged subgroup at higher risks of exposure to ambient air pollution and thus adverse health effects than the U.S. general population. Given the concerns and the knowledge gaps, there is a pressing need to conduct a comprehensive study to characterize the time-location patterns of this subpopulation in order to understand their exposure routes and potential sources of exposure to ambient air pollution.

In conclusion, given the low-employment rate in the WFS and CDS neighborhoods, a large number of residents, including children and unemployed adults, spent 93~100% (median) of their time in the neighborhood in both summer and winter seasons, independent of day-type, compared to 75~92% of the time spent by the employed adults in the neighborhood. Considering the WFS and CDS neighborhoods as hotspots of air pollution, the school children and unemployed adults in these two neighborhoods bear a greater potential for exposure to local ambient air pollution and thus adverse health effects. Furthermore, the participants at school/working age of the Camden study spent significantly more time outdoors and less time indoors and in vehicle(s) than the U.S. general population in both winter and summer, on weekdays and weekend days. Given the particular time-location patterns of the Camden cohort and the elevated air pollution of their neighborhoods, Camden residents, and especially the disadvantaged individuals, are more likely to experience higher exposure to air pollution than the U.S. general population.","in","The time-location patterns of the participants living in the WFS and CDS communities were similar under most of the circumstances, thus data collected from these communities were combined when compared with the NHAPS data. Compared to the U.S. general population, population in the WFS and CDS neighborhoods were younger and had more females. The Camden cohort spent significantly more time outdoors and less time indoors and in vehicle(s) than the U.S. general population (), for both genders and two age groups (children and adults at working age), in both seasons and on both weekdays and weekend days. In particular, the Camden study cohort spent a large amount of time outdoors (weighted average: 15.8%, 3.8 h), which is more than two times of the national average level (7.6%, 1.8 h).","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"yes",NA,"yes","can't tell","The National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS) [ - large sample size n=9386

However, health impact assessments of air pollution generally do not take socioeconomic status into account. In this paper, we propose an approach to the quantitative estimation of the short-term impacts of environmental risk factors such as air pollution among socioeconomically contrasted populations. We do so through an illustrative case study of ambient air pollution and emergency calls for asthma attacks in Strasbourg (France). Next, we discuss the potential advantages of this approach as well as its current limitations, and then look at the research needs that must be addressed to improve its applicability. Among these, the most urgent appear to be the needs for improved exposure estimates and for large-scale epidemiological studies that use harmonized methods to investigate the modification by socioeconomic status and other factors of the effects of air pollution.

The structural mechanisms distributing environmental injustices in the USA are understudied. Bridging the literatures on the social determinants of health and environmental justice highlights the importance of the environmental conditions for health inequalities and sheds light on the institutional mechanisms driving environmental health inequalities. Employing a critical quantitative methods approach, we use data from an innovative state racism index to argue that systematic racialized inequalities in areas from housing to employment increase outdoor airborne environmental health risks in neighborhoods. Results of a multilevel analysis in over 65,000 census tracts demonstrate that tracts in states with higher levels of state-level Black-white gaps report greater environmental health risk exposure to outdoor air pollution. The state racism index explains four-to-ten percent of county- and state-level variation in carcinogenic risk and noncarcinogenic respiratory system risks from outdoor air toxics.

Road transport is a major source producing the largest amount of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) (as a secondary pollutant). Hundreds of vehicles enter and exit the Tidworth Camp's main gate daily, potentially producing these pollutants. However, the air pollution exposure experienced by personnel on guard duty is unknown. This study aimed to determine and compare background NO2 and O-3 levels experienced by personnel on guard duty. Methods Cross-sectional data was collected using a static sampling technic on randomly selected days of the week. Data analysis was done using IBM-SPSS-26 and a p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The background concentration of NO2 and O-3 pollutants were within recommended limits. There was no significant difference between mean morning and afternoon exposure levels for both pollutants. However, NO2 and O-3 levels were significantly higher during weekdays compared to weekends (M = -0.022, SD = 0.007, t(6) = -8.672, p < 0.0001 and M = -0.016, SD = 0.008, t(6) = -5.040, p = 0.002 respectively). Both pollutants showed no significant differences in exposure levels when only weekdays were compared. NO2 levels showed a weak positive correlation during weekdays (r = 0.04) and a strong positive correlation during weekends (r = 0.96). O-3 levels had a positive correlation on both weekdays and weekends; however, levels on Monday showed a negative correlation (r = -0.55). Linear regression analysis showed that outside temperature was a significant predictor of O-3 levels (p = 0.026). Conclusion Personnel on guard duty experienced higher pollution levels during weekdays compared to weekends; however, air pollution levels for both pollutants were within recommended limits.

The study is based on a pool of 17 pregnant women residing in Hidalgo County, Texas. The traffic-related particulate matter with diameter of less than 2.5 micrometer (PM2.5) emissions and air pollutant concentrations are predicted using MOVES and AERMOD models, respectively. The daily average traffic-related PM2.5 concentration was found to be 0.32 mu g/m(3), with the highest concentration observed in transit (0.56 mu g/m(3)), followed by indoors (0.29 mu g/m(3)), and outdoor (0.26 mu g/m(3)) microenvironment. The obtained exposure levels exhibited considerable variation between time periods, with higher levels during peak commuting periods, close to the US-Mexico border region and lower levels observed during midday periods.

The emission data are modeled with EPA’s microscopic MOVES emission model that utilizes site-specific traffic activity data and other local specific data corresponding to vehicle age distribution, fuel supply, inspection/maintenance parameters, etc. These emission rates are combined with meteorological and land-use data in the dispersion module. Site-specific meteorological and land-use data are obtained from closest surface data and upper air weather stations. The pollutant dispersion is modeled using the AERMOD model at discrete receptor locations.

The GPS device tracked the location of the participants, which helped for accurate microenvironment classification. The process of converting the location information is described elsewhere [74]. The composite PM2.5 emission inventories for all roadway links are obtained from the latest version of EPA’s MOVES emission model. Surface data was obtained from the McAllen International Airport and the upper air data from the Brownsville Airport. The predominant wind direction is found to be from the south-east to north-west direction.

However, exposure of pregnant women is difficult to quantify, especially with regard to their mobility, which is rarely taken into account in epidemiological studies. This study aimed to assess the impact of mobility of pregnant women living in Paris, France, on their exposure estimates to nitrogen dioxide (NO2).MethodsA total of 486 pregnant women were recruited in 5 maternity hospitals in Paris between January and April 2016. A questionnaire was used to collect mothers' characteristics (demography, education, etc.) and to assess their daily mobility during pregnancy (time spent at work, commuting time and mode used to move from residential to occupational places). Daily NO2 concentrations were estimated based on the combination of annual average concentrations modeled at the census block scale and daily concentrations measured from fixed monitoring stations. Different models were used to compare the exposure of pregnant women in residential and occupational places, also taking into account travel time and travel mode. The socioeconomic profile of the census blocks was characterized using a multi-component index.ResultsDuring the first trimester of pregnancy, women living in the least deprived census blocks were exposed to higher concentrations of NO2 than those living in the most deprived ones. Occupational mobility had a small impact on exposure levels (average increase after taking account of mobility: +0.52g/m(3)) which was not related to the socioeconomic profile of the women. The commuting mode made a greater difference (+1.46g/m(3) on average), in particular among women living in the most deprived census blocks.ConclusionsOur study illustrates that air pollution exposure can be underestimated when ignoring occupational mobility and commuting mode of pregnant women.

A spatial exposure simulation model was used to estimate annual average exposure to traffic-related nitrogen dioxide for males and females reporting regular work in census tracts other than that of their residence, in Vancouver, British Columbia. The model produced estimates of annual average exposure in six microenvironments (home indoor, work indoor, other indoor, outdoor, in-vehicle to work, and in-vehicle other) using time-activity patterns and work flow data, for males and females in each of 382 census tracts. This allowed for the identification of spatial variations in exposure estimates for each gender, due to mobility within the study region. Indoor sources of nitrogen dioxide were not included in the simulation. No significant differences in estimated total exposure were found between working females and males in general. Small but observable spatial differences, however, were found between working females and males at the 90th percentile of the exposure distributions associated specifically with the work indoor microenvironment. These were highest in suburban areas (+3 g/m3 for females, relative to total exposures in the range of 26 to 37 g/m3 annual average hourly nitrogen dioxide).

Our statistical models found evidence that the operation of mechanical ventilation systems could mitigate the intrusion of outdoor PM2.5: during standard work hours, a 10 isg/m3 increase in outdoor PM2.5 was associated with 19.9% increase in the expected concentration of indoor PM2.5 (p < 0.0001), compared to a larger 23.4% increase during non-work hours (p < 0.0001). Finally, our models found that using filters with ratings of MERV 13-14 or MERV 15+ was associated with a 30.9% (95% CI: -55.0%, +6.2%) or 39.4% (95% CI: -62.0%, -3.4%) reduction of indoor PM2.5, respectively, compared to filters with lower MERV 7-12 ratings.

Linear additive mixed models [29] were used to evaluate the impact of buildings’ self-reported filter ratings on hourly indoor PM2.5 levels. The primary analysis included two models: one model during standard work hours, when ventilation systems were assumed to be operating normally (weekdays between 9:00 and 17:00 local time), and one model during assumed non-work hours, when ventilation systems may have been scaled back or not operating (weekends or weekdays before 7:00 or after 19:00 local time). The modeled outcome was the natural logarithm of hourly indoor PM2.5, with zeros substituted by half of the lowest non-zero PM2.5 concentration measured by the same sensor. The models included nested random intercepts for the PM2.5 sensor unit and for the building to account for non-independence of measurements made by a single PM2.5 sensor package and of measurements made within the same building. The models also included a spline on local datetime to account for serial correlation in measurements.
Additional categorical covariates in the models included variables representing the countries where buildings were located (in the models for standard work hours and non-work hours) and quartiles of estimated quarterly building air exchange rates (in the model for standard work hours only). Continuous covariates in the models included building age and hourly outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. Dichotomous variables representing buildings’ green building certification status (certified or not certified) and healthy building certification status (certified or not certified) were considered for inclusion in the models, but were ultimately excluded because their inclusion resulted in lower adjusted R2 values for both models. A model with outdoor PM2.5 lagged by one hour was also considered, but the model with concurrent indoor and outdoor PM2.5 measurements was used as the final model because it had a higher adjusted R2 than the lagged model.

One hundred and twenty healthy young men were assigned to untrained (n = 52), indoor exercise (n = 36), and outdoor exercise (n = 32) groups, following their lifestyle exercise habits, and O(3) and NO(2) were assessed by personal monitoring. Exercised groups demonstrated higher healthy eating index (HEI) (p < 0.001), physical activity (PA) (p < 0.001), metabolic equivalent of task (MET) (p < 0.001), and peak oxygen uptake VO(2peak) (p < 0.001), while outdoor group had lower LAP index (p < 0.001) and higher O(3) concentration (p = 0.0442).

This study aimed to quantify the tradeoff of PA under fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) air pollution by estimating the optimal PA duration under various pollution levels. METHODS: A risk-benefit analysis was performed to estimate the optimal outdoor moderate-intensity PA (MPA) duration under varying PM(2.5) concentrations. RESULTS: An inverse nonlinear relationship was identified between optimal MPA duration and background PM(2.5) concentration levels. When background PM(2.5) concentration increased to 186 µg/m(3), the optimal outdoor MPA duration decreased to 2.5 h/week, the minimum level recommended by current PA guidelines. When background PM(2.5) concentration further increased to 235 µg/m(3), the optimal outdoor MPA duration decreased to 1 h/week. The relationship between optimal MPA duration and background PM(2.5) concentration levels was stronger when exercising at a location closer to a source of air pollution. Compared to the general adult population, adults aged 60 years and older had substantially steeper curves-the optimal outdoor MPA duration decreased to 2.5 h/week when background PM(2.5) concentration reached 45 µg/m(3). CONCLUSION: The health benefit of outdoor MPA by far outweighs the health risk of PM(2.5) pollution for the global average urban background concentration (22 µg/m(3)). This modeling study examined a single type of air pollutant and suffered from measurement errors and estimation uncertainties.

It has been reported that short-term lung function increases as a response to physical activity, but this beneficial effect is hampered when elevated air pollution concentrations are observed. Our study assessed the long-term impact of air pollution on the pulmonary health benefit of physical activity. METHODS: Wearable sensors were used to monitor physical activity levels (SenseWear) and exposure to black carbon (microAeth) of 115 healthy adults during 1 wk in three European cities (Antwerp, Barcelona, London). The experiment was repeated in three different seasons to approximate long-term behavior. Spirometry tests were performed at the beginning and end of each measurement week. All results were averaged on a participant level as a proxy for long-term lung function. Mixed effect regression models were used to analyze the long-term impact of physical activity, black carbon and their interaction on lung function parameters, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, forced expiratory flow (FEF)25-75, and peak expiratory flow. Interaction plots were used to interpret the significant interaction effects. RESULTS: Negative interaction effects of physical activity and black carbon exposure on FEV1 (P = 0.07), FEV1/FVC (P = 0.03), and FEF25-75 (P = 0.03) were observed. For black carbon concentrations up to approximately 1 µg·m, an additional MET·h·wk resulted in a trend toward lung function increases (FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FEF25-75 increased 5.6 mL, 0.1% and 14.5 mL·s, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We found that lung function improved with physical activity at low black carbon levels. This beneficial effect decreased in higher air pollution concentrations. Our results suggest a greater need to reduce air pollution exposures during physical activity.","Med Sci Sports Exerc, 50:9  1875-1881",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"interest",NA,NA,"EC","longitudinal cohort","Our study assessed the long-term impact of air pollution on the pulmonary health benefit of physical activity.","PM10, PM2.5","general outdoor air pollition","Persons who perform recreational activities outdoors","three European cities (Antwerp, Barcelona, London).

We calculated the mean of the three measurements per participant as a proxy for long-term physical activity behavior and long-term personal BC exposure. This is justified as we objectively measured physical activity and BC concentrations during a whole week in three different seasons. Consequently, differences due to seasonal changes were accounted for. Three participants did not complete all three measurement weeks and were excluded from the analysis. Also, only nonsmokers (n = 100) and former smokers (n = 19) were recruited. Pack years of former smokers were low with an average of 2.7 ± 2.9. This corresponds to 20 cigarettes per day during 2.7 yr. Four of those former smokers were excluded from the analysis since they quit smoking less than 5 yr ago. This resulted in a total of 115 eligible participants out of 122. Long-term lung function parameters were approximated by calculating the average FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, FEF25–75, and PEF per participant.

The study population was described by sex, age, ethnicity, height, BMI, and education level. For categorical variables, the amount (n) and percentage was reported. Arithmetic mean and SD were used for continuous variables and pulmonary outcomes. In addition, the overall and city-specific median and interquartile range (IQR) of physical activity and BC concentrations were calculated.

The effects of long-term physical activity, air pollution, and their interaction were tested using mixed effect regression models where city was introduced as a random variable. First, we tested the effects of physical activity and BC on lung function separately. Then the effects of physical activity and BC were estimated together in one single model. Finally, models including the interaction term were tested. All models included sex, age, and height based on the European Respiratory Society and the American Thoracic Society guidelines (18). To account for socioeconomic differences, education level was also added as a covariate.

The significance level was set at P < 0.05. When trends toward significant interaction effects were observed (P < 0.1), regression estimates of physical activity were plotted with their 95% confidence interval as a function of BC concentrations in an interaction plot.

R software version 3.3.1 was used for data processing and analysis. Random intercept models were tested with the lme4 and lmerTest R-packages for mixed effect regression analysis. All marginal residuals were normally distributed. Interaction plots were made using the R-package Interplot.","We found that lung function improved with physical activity at low black carbon levels.

The commuter pairs began their journey together but took different routes through the city. The commute chosen was 8.4–9 km long (4.2–4.5 km each way depending on the transport mode) from the suburban area of the IDAEA-CSIC Institute in Pedralbes to the Diagonal metro stop on La Rambla in the city centre (Fig. 1). Four types of commute were included in the study: walking only, walking+tram, bus, and subway train (Metro).","Average BC values were highest when walking in the congested inner city Diagonal (9.6 µg m-3), lower in the metro (7 µg m-3), when walking along the more open suburban Diagonal (6.5 µg m-3) and riding inside the bus (5.5 µg m-3), and lowest when travelling by tram (3.4 µg m-3).

we analysed 6 filters per subject, this is 12 filters in total including 3 for each of the four transport modes. PM2.5 concentrations were measured using a DustTrack monitor (DT: Model 8533, TSI) and corrected based on a comparison against simultaneous gravimetric PM2.5 (MCV High Volume sampler) at the urban background site of Palau Reial in Barcelona after the sampling campaigns. Although a good relative correlation was observed between PM2.5 urban background measures in the local station and the values registered in the DustTrak while walking (R2=0.82) the latter were always much higher in absolute values. The correlation between the PM2.5 concentrations determined by the gravimetric PM2.5 concentrations from PEM filters and the DustTrak showed a poorer correlation (R2=0.55) and again DustTrak values show much higher concentrations.
The N concentrations in the range of 10–300 nm were measured using a NanoTracer (Philips Aerasense Nanotracer, NT) A particle number concentration correction factor was derived for each NT at the start of the project by running side by side with a TSI model 3775 condensation particle counter (CPC) calibrated at the European Accredited Laboratory of the University of Cassino and Southern Lazio (Italy). Black Carbon (BC) was measured using a mini-aethalometer (MicroAeth AE51) and carbon dioxide and monoxide with a IAQ-Calc equipment (Model 7545, TSI) which also recorded T and RH values. Further details on monitoring, analytical procedures and meteorological conditions are provided in Supplementary Information and Fig. S1.
A normality test was applied to determine the type of distribution of the data, if parametric (normal) or non-parametric. The distribution of the N concentration was found to be not symmetric but skewed-right, due to few high values increasing the mean value, but this does not affect the median. Therefore, the Kruskal–Wallis test was applied for comparing two or more samples that are independent, based on analysis of variance: a p-value < 0.01 was regarded as statistically significant.","Average number concentrations of particles 10-300 nm in size, N, are lowest in the commute using subway trains (N<2.5×104 part. cm-3), higher during tram travel and suburban walking (2.5×104 cm-3<N<5.0×104 cm-3), and highest in diesel bus or walking in the city centre (N>5.0×104 cm-3), with extreme transient peaks at busy traffic crossings commonly exceeding 1.0×105 cm-3 and accompanied by peaks in Black Carbon and CO.

The aethalometer computes the difference with the previous measurement, and therefore, negative measurements are considered offsets in the next observations. On the other hand, negative values in MicroAeth can also be due to sharp changes in relative humidity (i.e., when moving from the indoor to the outdoor environment), as demonstrated by Cai et al. (2014). Although negatives values have been included into the analyses, the 1st percentile has been considered as the minimum when reporting the range in the results section as negative concentrations have no physical meaning.

When comparing data between the different monitoring stations, only data for which simultaneous measurements were available were used (casewise deletion). To assess the relationship between EBC personal measurements and EBC measurements at fixed stations, we carried out linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) with school and student as random effect to account for the repetitive measurement and assessed the proportion of variance that explains the fixed part of the model (R 2).

All the statistical analyses (data management, descriptive statistics, time series and LMMs) were performed with the 10 min averaged values with the R statistical software (v 3.1.0., R Core Team, 2014) and the packages openair (Carslaw and Ropkins, 2012) and lme4 (Bates et al., 2014), among others.","The highest (geometric) mean EBC concentrations corresponded to personal monitoring (20% higher than at the school fixed stations, 10% higher than in the urban background) owing to peak concentration events during commuting times. This was due to two reasons: the co-occurrence of children commuting times and road traffic rush hours, and the closest proximity to the source (road traffic) while commuting. In fact, children spend only the 6% of their daily time in commuting, while based on our estimations, they received around 20% of their total daily EBC dose during this activity. Children spent 82% of their time in indoor environments (classroom and home), where they received 76% and 56% of their daily-integrated exposure and dose, respectively. Considering the important amount of time spent in the indoor environments, it is important to characterize indoor environments for an accurate exposure assessment to EBC. The contribution from schools (including classroom and playground) to the total daily-integrated EBC dose was the 37%, and the highest dose:time intensity was observed during commuting times. Reducing traffic intensities around schools should be enhanced to minimize the exposure of a wide fraction of the population who spend a large portion of their weekdays in a shared location.","in","PM size not reported - just reported as BC","yes",NA,"yes",NA,"not relevant",NA,"no","yes","small sample, most schools located in barcelona.","no","receruited from the BREATHE Project","d.

Air toxics exposure was greater for minority race/ethnicity (p<0.0001), low income (p<0.0001), non-rural area (p<0.001). Across all analyses, greater air toxics exposure, as represented by total NATA respiratory hazard index, or when limited to respiratory hazard index from onroad mobile sources or diesel PM, was not associated with a greater prevalence of asthma or hospitalizations (p trend >0.05). In adjusted logistic regression models, children exposed to the highest respiratory hazard index were not more likely to have asthma compared to those exposed to the lowest respiratory hazard index of total, onroad sources, or diesel PM. CONCLUSIONS: Early childhood exposure to outdoor air toxics in a national sample has not previously been studied relative to children's asthma. Within the constraints of the study, we found no evidence that early childhood exposure to outdoor air toxics increased risk for asthma. As has been previously reported, it is evident that there are environmental justice and disparity concerns for exposure to air toxics and asthma prevalence in US children.","PLoS One, 8:9  e75176",NA,NA,"No","outdoor","no","can't tell","yes","yes","yes","sociodemographic disparities","no","No relevant pollutants","ML","Exposure study","Are air toxics exposure in early childhood related to asthma risk or severity",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"out","No relevant pollutants",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Also, children living in areas with high air pollution levels and/or high traffic densities appear to have chronically increased levels of exhaled NO. No studies have simultaneously addressed the long-term and short-term associations between traffic-related air pollution and exhaled NO. OBJECTIVES: To investigate associations between exhaled NO in school children and both short-term changes in outdoor PM(10) and long-term traffic exposures. METHODS: Offline exhaled NO measurements were conducted in 812 children from nine Dutch schools within 400 m of motorways. Daily levels of particulate matter with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 µm (PM(10)) were obtained from background monitoring stations. Long-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution was assessed using specific traffic-related characteristics such as total, car and truck motorway traffic and the distances of the children's homes and schools from the motorway. RESULTS: A positive association was found between ambient PM(10) concentrations on the day of exhaled NO measurement and exhaled NO (adjusted geometric means ratio (95% CI) 2.24 (1.37 to 3.65)) over the range of daily PM(10) concentrations of 44 µg/m(3)), which was largely attributable to a pollution peak associated with high particulate matter emissions from traditional Easter fires. There were suggestive associations between exhaled NO and traffic counts only in children with asthma, which were not statistically significance. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term changes in ambient PM(10) largely attributable to biomass burning are associated with increased levels of exhaled NO.","Occup Environ Med, 68:8  551-6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"place of residence; children",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"no full text available",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Of particular concern are ultrafine particles which are emitted in large quantities, contain large concentrations of toxins and are deposited deeply in the respiratory tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, an intensive sampling campaign of indoor and outdoor airborne particulate matter was carried out in a primary school in February 2006 to investigate indoor and outdoor particle number (PN) and mass concentrations (PM(2.5)), and particle size distribution, and to evaluate the influence of outdoor air pollution on the indoor air. RESULTS: For outdoor PN and PM(2.5), early morning and late afternoon peaks were observed on weekdays, which are consistent with traffic rush hours, indicating the predominant effect of vehicular emissions. However, the temporal variations of outdoor PM(2.5) and PN concentrations occasionally showed extremely high peaks, mainly due to human activities such as cigarette smoking and the operation of mower near the sampling site. The indoor PM(2.5) level was mainly affected by the outdoor PM(2.5) (r = 0.68, p < 0.01), whereas the indoor PN concentration had some association with outdoor PN values (r = 0.66, p < 0.01) even though the indoor PN concentration was occasionally influenced by indoor sources, such as cooking, cleaning and floor polishing activities. Correlation analysis indicated that the outdoor PM(2.5) was inversely correlated with the indoor to outdoor PM(2.5) ratio (I/O ratio; r = -0.49, p < 0.01), while the indoor PN had a weak correlation with the I/O ratio for PN (r = 0.34, p < 0.01). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that occupancy did not cause any major changes to the modal structure of particle number and size distribution, even though the I/O ratio was different for different size classes. The I/O curves had a maximum value for particles with diameters of 100-400 nm under both occupied and unoccupied scenarios, whereas no significant difference in I/O ratio for PM(2.5) was observed between occupied and unoccupied conditions. Inspection of the size-resolved I/O ratios in the preschool centre and the classroom suggested that the I/O ratio in the preschool centre was the highest for accumulation mode particles at 600 nm after school hours, whereas the average I/O ratios of both nucleation mode and accumulation mode particles in the classroom were much lower than those of Aitken mode particles. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The findings obtained in this study are useful for epidemiological studies to estimate the total personal exposure of children, and to develop appropriate control strategies for minimising the adverse health effects on school children.","Environ Sci Pollut Res Int, 17:6  1268-78",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"school children; outdoor/indoor",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The study took place in Brisbane/Australia and is therefore not within scope for this review",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Air pollution, deprivation and poor-health status combinations can create increased and disproportionate disease burdens. Problems and solutions are rarely considered in a broad public health context, but doing so can add value to air quality management efforts by reducing air pollution risks, impacts and inequalities. Methods An ecological study assessed small-area associations between air pollution (nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter), deprivation status and health outcomes in Wales, UK. Results Air pollution concentrations were highest in 'most' deprived areas. When considered separately, deprivation-health associations were stronger than air pollution-health associations. Considered simultaneously, air pollution added to deprivation-health associations; interactions between air pollution and deprivation modified and strengthened associations with all-cause and respiratory disease mortality, especially in 'most' deprived areas where most-vulnerable people lived and where health needs were greatest. Conclusion There is a need to reduce air pollution-related risks for all. However, it is also the case that greater health gains can result from considering local air pollution problems and solutions in the context of wider health-determinants and acting on a better understanding of relationships. Informed and co-ordinated air pollution mitigation and public health action in high deprivation and pollution areas can reduce risks and inequalities. To achieve this, greater public health integration and collaboration in local air quality management policy and practice is needed.","Journal of Public Health 2017 Vol. 39 Issue 3 Pages 485-497","pdf",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"MC","Ecological","Small-area associations between air pollution (nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter), deprivation status and health outcomes in Wales, UK","NO2, PM10, PM2.5","Unclear","Full populaton","Not mentioned",NA,NA,"NA","NA","There isn't a gradient in PM in Wales

It demonstrates a compelling environmental and social injustice narrative with strong policy implications for the UK and beyond. In the first instance, this research presents a decadal update for England and Wales to Mitchell and Dorling's 2003 analysis of environmental justice in the UK. Using 2011 UK Government pollution and emissions data with 2011 UK Census socioeconomic and demographic data based on small area census geographies, this paper demonstrates a stronger relationship between age, poverty, road NOx emissions and exposure to NO2 concentrations. Areas with the highest proportions of under-fives and young adults, and poorer households, have the highest concentrations of traffic-related pollution. In addition, exclusive access to UK annual vehicle safety inspection records ('MOT' tests) allowed annual private vehicle NOx emissions to be spatially attributed to registered keepers. Areal analysis against Census-based socioeconomic characteristics identified that households in the poorest areas emit the least NOx and PM, whilst the least poor areas emitted the highest, per km, vehicle emissions per household through having higher vehicle ownership, owning more diesel vehicles and driving further. In conclusion, the analysis indicates that, despite more than a decade of air quality policy, environmental injustice of air pollution exposure has worsened. New evidence regarding the responsibility for generation of road traffic emissions provides a clear focus for policy development and targeted implementation.","Transportation Research Part D-Transport and Environment 2019 Vol. 73 Pages 56-66","pdf",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"MA","Ecological","None specified","NO2, PM10","Road traffic","Age, poverty, car ownership","They look at 10 year age bands, England and Wales","age",NA,"NA","NA","Infants and young adults living in places have higher NO2 (with those areas not producing the emissions), although less overall impact as levels have come down over time","NA","NA","quantitatively",NA,"Emission factor; mean total,

1216,NA,"MC","Brown","2021","Brown-2021",NA,"Elevated urban Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) is a consequence of road traffic and other fossil-fuel combustion sources, and the road transport sector provides a significant contribution to UK NO2 emissions. The inhalation of traffic-related air pollution, including NO2, can cause a range of problems to human health. Due to their developing organs, children are particularly susceptible to the negative effects of air pollution inhalation. Accordingly, schools and associated travel behaviours present an important area of study for the reduction of child exposure to these harmful pollutants. COVID-19 reached the UK in late January 2020. On the 23rd of March that year, the UK government announced a nationwide stay-at-home order, or lockdown, banning all non-essential travel and contact with people outside of their own homes. The lockdown was accompanied by the closure of schools, public facilities, amenities, businesses and places of worship. The current study aims to assess the significance of nationwide NO2 reductions at schools in England as a consequence of the lockdown in order to highlight the benefits of associated behavioural changes within the context of schools in England and potential child exposure. NO2 data were collected from all AURN (Automatic Urban and Rural Network) monitoring sites within 500 m of nurseries, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges in England. A significant reduction of mean NO2 concentrations was observed in the first month of the UK lockdown at background (-35.13%) and traffic (-40.82%) sites. Whilst lockdown restrictions are undoubtedly unsustainable, the study results demonstrate the possible reductions of NO2 at schools in England and potential reductions of child exposure that are achievable when public behaviours shift towards active travel, work from home policies and generally lower use of polluting vehicles.
